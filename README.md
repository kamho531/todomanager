# ToDo Manager
ToDomanager is an Android app which lets users create a To Do list in a user-friendly environment. Simply input the to-do item, select the priority of the item, pick the date and time, and finally submit, users will see an entry of the to-do item in the list. If users have created several items, just click any entry, an pop-up will confirm users before deleting the item.
